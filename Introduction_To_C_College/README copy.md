Each of these directories contain the source files for each of my class projects in labeled folders by their module and project name for ease of navigation. The `README.md` file at the root of my repository contains an overview of all my projects and specific details are within each project's directory.

## Project Descriptions:

#### Module-One-Programming-Assignments
These projects focus on the basics of C programming such as declaring and initializing variables, using escape sequences, performing mathematical operations and learning about data types. 

#### Module-Two-Programming-Assignments
These projects build on the basics learned in module one but introduce conditional statements and loops. The programs in this module are more complex and interactive, requiring user input and providing calculated output. 

All of my C projects in this repository follow ANSI C compatibility best practices including using `int main()` and `return 0;`. The code in each of these files is also well-documented with header comments and comments within the code, especially with respect to calculations.

## C Class Projects

Here are some of the projects I have completed in my C class:

### Module One Programming Assignment

1. [`clooney.c`](clooney.c): A program that declares and initializes variables including First_name, Middle_Initial, Last_name, Year_born, Height_in_meters, Net_worth_USD and prints the desired information using printf(). [Link to Source Code](clooney.c)
  
2. [`temp.c`](temp.c): A program that uses escape sequences to output specific strings including 'Single quotes', "Double quotes", \Backslashes\ and using a tab. [Link to Source Code](temp.c)

3. `temps_averager.c`: A program that declares, initializes two temperature variables, calculates, and outputs their average. [Link to Source Code](temps_averager.c)

4. [`mathCalcs.c`](mathCalcs.c): A program that declares an integer variable named "number" and initializes the variable with value 11, then performs various mathematical operations and displays the results. [Link to Source Code](mathCalcs.c)

5. [`ageConversion.c`](ageConversion.c): A program that takes an age in years input and converts it to days. [Link to Source Code](ageConversion.c)


### Moduler Two Programming Assignment

1. [`hwwhileloop.c`](hwwhileloop.c): A program that displays all the odd numbers from 1 to 100 using a while loop. [Link to Source Code](hwwhileloop.c)

2. [`hwinteger.c`](hwinteger.c): A program that prompts the user to enter an integer value, then uses a while loop to display the user-entered value and the next 10 consecutive integers. [Link to Source Code](hwinteger.c)

3. [`trip_time.c`](trip_time.c): A program that asks users to enter trip details, then calculates and displays the expected trip duration. [Link to Source Code](trip_time.c)

4. [`hours_min.c`](hours_min.c): A program that converts seconds to hours and minutes, allowing the user to repeatedly enter values and terminating when the user enters a value less than or equal to zero. [Link to Source Code](hours_min.c)

5. [`sales_tax.c`](sales_tax.c): A program that calculates and displays the cost of an item including sales tax. The sales tax is rounded-up, not truncated, and displayed in dollars and cents format. [Link to Source Code](sales_tax.c)

**Note**: Click on the project name to view the C source files.

All of the above programs follow "standard" C formatting and style, are well-documented with header comments, comments within the code, especially ALL calculations, and they all follow the best practices of ANSI C compatibility, using int main() and "return 0;". The user interface is clear, informative and friendly, with all the program brief descriptions presented to the user and a clear indication of what the output represents.

## Submissions ##
Each program should be compiled, executed and its .c file should be submitted by attaching separately in the submission box for Module 1 or Module 2 Programming Assignment. In total, the submission box for Module 1 Programming Assignment should have five files attached, each with a .c file extension, and similarly the box for Module 2 Programming Assignment should have five attached files, all with .c file extensions. The filenames should match those identified in the programs' header comments.
